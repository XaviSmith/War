# War

Simple C# implementation of the card game War with 2 players. 

## Instructions
-Double-click War.exe in the root folder.

-Press enter to take a turn/advance text.

-Game ends when a player runs out of cards

-If you wish to enable/disable debug logs (e.g. Seeing what the deck looks like after being shuffled), set logsEnabled to **true** in War/Program.cs

### Notes
In this variation of the game, whenever a player wins in a hand, it's added to a secondary "spoils" deck. Once the player has played all their cards, the spoils deck is shuffled and added to the player's hand.
